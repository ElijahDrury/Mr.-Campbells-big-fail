With a passion for technology and a commitment to fostering a love for learining he goes abouve and beyond to ensure that his students grasp comples concepts and develp practical skills.

                <li> Everyone was focused on the test that we were taking</li>
                <li>It's early in the<strong> morning </strong> </li>
                 <li> Accidentally <em>Mistaked</em> Someones name</li>

     <td><p>The Test was so difficult because we were constantly being distracted by mr Cambpell entering and exiting the classroom. This was bad. Although, this is only an excuse because I am upset by my grade, others felt this way aswell.</p></td>

    <p> This was obviously a lie. The only person who was crying after the test was Celia, as she felt that she had a strong friendship with Mr. Campbell, and this had been disproven by his mistaking of her name. </p>
                  <p> At this point I am just typing anything in an attempt to write 5 paragraphs, Sometimes I wonder if i actually know how to read or if I've just mesmerized a lot of words.</p>
                  <p> Alright thank god this is the last one that i have to write. Hopefully you learned something on my slide thanks for reading.</p>
